### 💡 What I Learned

Throughout building this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

- 🧠 **DOM Manipulation** using vanilla JavaScript to dynamically update content and handle user interaction.
- 📱 **Responsive Design** with Flexbox and media queries to ensure the game works smoothly across desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.
- 🖱️ **Event Handling** to manage game logic, user input, and trigger actions on clicks.
- 💬 **Creating Modals** using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display the result (Win/Lose/Draw) in a smooth, styled popup.
- 🎨 **UI/UX Design** principles applied to build a visually engaging, interactive game interface — all without using any external frameworks or libraries.
